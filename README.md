# Introduction

Bubuku - supervisor for kafka


Google translate with automatic language detection says that it means 'day' in
Xhosa language.


The purpose of bubuku is to start, monitor and rebalance kafka cluster in AWS setup, handling these actions in 
coordinated manner.
 
Bubuku assumes that kafka is already installed on a machine. Version of kafka that is tested to be working
with current release: 0.9.0.1

# Installation
```
pip3 install bubuku
```

# Running
Start supervisor:
```
KAFKA_DIR=/opt/kafka KAFKA_SETTINGS=/opt/kafka/config/server.properties ZOOKEEPER_STACK_NAME=my_zookeeper \
ZOOKEEPER_PREFIX=/test BROKER_ID_POLICY=ip BUKU_FEATURES=restart_on_exhibitor,graceful_terminate \
HEALTH_PORT=8888 bubuku-daemon
```
Run commands on cluster:
```
export KAFKA_DIR=/opt/kafka
export KAFKA_SETTINGS=/opt/kafka/config/server.properties 
export ZOOKEEPER_STACK_NAME=my_zookeeper 
export ZOOKEEPER_PREFIX=/test 
export BROKER_ID_POLICY=ip

# Restart kafka on current node
bubuku-cli restart
# Restart kafka on some other node (broker id must be known)
bubuku-cli restart --broker=12324

# Invoke partitions rebalance
bubuku-cli rebalance
```
It is important to have all properties provided, because command processing is made over zookeeper stack. 

# Configuration

Bubuku can be configured using environment properties:

 - `KAFKA_DIR` - kafka root directory (for example /opt/kafka) 
 - `KAFKA_SETTINGS` - Path to kafka settings template file. Bubuku will add (or replace/delete) it's own 
 properties to this file and write the contents to `${KAFKA_DIR}/config/server.properties`. Kafka will be started 
  against generated file.
 - `ZOOKEEPER_STACK_NAME` - AWS load balancer name for zookeeper stack
 - `ZOOKEEPER_STATIC_IPS_PORT` - (overrides ZOOKEEPER_STACK_NAME) - static list 
 of ips/port of zookeeper stack in the following form: 127.0.0.1,127.0.0.2,127.0.0.3:2181 - several ips and 1 port 
 - `ZOOKEEPER_PREFIX` - Prefix for all the nodes in zk for kafka and bubuku
 - `BROKER_ID_POLICY` - Policy for generating broker id. Possible values are `ip` and `auto`
 - `BUKU_FEATURES` - List of optional bubuku features, see [features](#features) section
 - `HEALTH_PORT` - Port for health checks
 - `FREE_SPACE_DIFF_THRESHOLD_MB` - Threshold for starting `balance_data_size` feature, if it's enabled
 - `STARTUP_TIMEOUT_TYPE`, `STARTUP_TIMEOUT_INITIAL`, `STARTUP_TIMEOUT_STEP` - The way bubuku manages [time to start for kafka](#startup_timeout).
 
# Features #

Bubuku provides:
    
 - Ip address discovery using AWS
 - Exhibitor discovery using AWS load balancer name
 - Rebalance partitions on different events
 - React on exhibitor topology change
 - Automatic kafka restart in case if broker is considered dead
 - Graceful broker termination in case of supervisor stop
 - Broker start/stop/restart synchronization across cluster
 
## <a name="features"></a> Pluggable features
Pluggable features are defined in configuration and are disabled by default. List of features:
 
 - `restart_on_exhibitor` - restart kafka broker on zookeeper address list change. Kafka by itself do not support
 zookeeper list provider, so in order to override list of zookeeper instances in runtime there will be configuration
 change and broker restart. This change is made one by one for each broker in cluster (so kafka instances won't die
 all at the same time)
 - `rebalance_on_start` - Rebalance partition distribution across cluster (using partition count and leader count
 per broker as optimization strategy) during initial broker startup
 - `rebalance_on_brokers_change` - Rebalance partition distribution across cluster (using partition count and leader 
 count per broker as optimization strategy) on any broker list change (new broker started, old broker died)
 - `graceful_terminate` - In case when bubuku is killed, try to gracefully terminate kafka process.
 - `use_ip_address` - Use ip address when registering kafka instance. By default kafka registers itself in 
 zookeeper using hostname. Sometimes (for example on migration between AWS regions) it makes sense to use ip 
 address instead of hostname.
 - `balance_data_size` - Swap partitions one by one by one if imbalance in size on brokers is bigger than 
 `FREE_SPACE_DIFF_THRESHOLD_MB` megabytes.
 
## <a name="startup_timeout"></a> Timeouts for startup
 Each time when bubuku tries to start kafka, it uses special startup timeout. This means, that if kafka broker id 
 is not found within this timeout in zookeeper node `/broker/ids/{id}`, kafka process will be forcibly killed, timeout 
 for start updated, and startup will be retried. 
  
  There are two ways to increase timeout - linear and progressive. Linear adds the same amount of time after each 
  failed start. Progressive adds time, that is relative to current timeout. Configuration for that is provided by 
  `STARTUP_TIMEOUT_TYPE`, `STARTUP_TIMEOUT_INITIAL`, `STARTUP_TIMEOUT_STEP` parameters.
  ```
  # Linear timeout configuration 
  # initial timeout=300 seconds, after each failed start increase by 60 seconds (360, 420 and so on)
  export STARTUP_TIMEOUT_TYPE="linear"
  export STARTUP_TIMEOUT_INITIAL="300"
  export STARTUP_TIMEOUT_STEP="60"
  ```
  ```
  # Progressive timeout configuration
  # Initial timeout=300 seconds, after each failed start increase by timeout * 0.5 (450, 675 and so on)
  export STARTUP_TIMEOUT_TYPE="progressive"
  export STARTUP_TIMEOUT_INITIAL="300"
  export STARTUP_TIMEOUT_STEP="0.5"
  ```

 Default values for timeout are
 ```
  export STARTUP_TIMEOUT_TYPE="linear"
  export STARTUP_TIMEOUT_INITIAL="300"
  export STARTUP_TIMEOUT_STEP="60"
 ```
 
# Command line interface

Bubuku provides a command line tool `bubuku-cli` which should be used directly on the instance. See detailed
description of all commands [here](https://github.com/zalando-nakadi/bubuku/blob/master/cli_docs/cli.md).
